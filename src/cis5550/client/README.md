# READ ME
This is a simple search application with dummy data that allows users to search for items and filter them by category. The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Getting started
To get started with the app, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The app does not require any server or database setup, and all the necessary JavaScript functions are included in the HTML file.

# Usage
Once you have the app running in your browser, you can start searching for items using the search bar. Type your query into the input field and hit the "Search" button to see the results.

By default, the search results will be displayed in a list format with the url and a short description. You can navigate through the pages of search results by clicking on the page number buttons at the bottom of the list.

You can also filter the search results by category by clicking on one of the category buttons at the top of the page. The category buttons include "Books", "Music", "Sports", and "Travel". When you click on a category button, the app will automatically perform a search using the category value.

# Dummy data
The app uses dummy data to simulate an API response. The dummy data includes three sets of search results, each with five items, and a set of 200 items for testing purposes. To see the full set of 200 items, search for the term "long".

# TODO:

Under the TODO comment, there is code provided for connecting with an API. Replace the API link with the appropriate one and comment out the code for generating dummy data.
